## How to Run Locally

This is a static website with no build step required. You can run it in any of the following ways:

### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Option 2: Use a Local Server

For a more production-like environment, you can use a simple HTTP server:

**With Python:**
```
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

**With Node.js:**
```
# Install http-server globally if you don't have it
npm install -g http-server

# Run the server
http-server
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown in your terminal).
